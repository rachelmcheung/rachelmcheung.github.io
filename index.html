      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Galapagos penguins are the third smallest species of penguin in the world that live on the equator. They stand 40 to 45 cm tall and weigh 1.6 to 2. The closest relatives to the Galapagos Penguin include 
      African Penguin, Magellanic Penguin, and Humboldt Penguin.Not to mention, they are one of seventeen species of flightless birds. Galapagos Penguins are one of the world's rarest penguins with an estimated population    of less than 2,000 breeding pairs.

<br><h4>Physical Appearance and Behaviour</h4>

<p>The Galapagos penguin has a black head with a white line running from behind its eyes, to its throat.
Galapagos penguins have blackish-grey upperparts and whitish underparts, with the lower band extending down the flanks
to the thigh. Male Galapagos penguins are greater in size in comparison to the females.</p>

<p>These penguins are very friendly and social, because they like all other penguin species. Galapagos penguins rely on a series of 
vocal calls and sounds as well as a complex array of body movements to communicate. This species has a number of behavioral adaptations 
that allow these birds to keep cool on land. These include standing with the flippers
extended to aid heat loss, as well as panting and seeking shade.They keep cool by swimming
and hunting for food in the cold water of the Cromwell Current during the day. They hold their flippers out to help cool themselves and protect
their feet from getting sunburned by holding their flippers over their feet when on land.</p>

      <h3>Habitat</h3>
      <p>Majority of the world's Galapagos penguins live near 
the equator on Galapagos Island.Galapagos Island is located in 
the Pacific Ocean, and it is west Equador. This island is made 
up of several smaller islands. Galapagos Penguins live on the 
islands of Fernandina and Isabela of Galapagos Island.They can 
be seen on Satiago, Bartolome, northern Santa Cruz, and Floreana. Galapagos penguins are thought to have
been brought to the Galapagos islands by the Humboldt Current, which brings cold temperatures and
nutrients north from Antarctica. </p>
<h4>Climate</h4>
<p>One of the main problems for these penguins is keeping cool. Living 
close to the equator it can get to over 38 degrees C during the daytime. Thanks to the confluence of cold water currents from the west and the south, the Galapagos 
archipelago has an uncharacteristically dry and moderate climate for the tropics
and is generally classified as sub-tropical. This makes Galapagos travel a 
year-round vacation option. Galapagos weather is considered equatorial, cooled 
by the Humboldt Current, and is characterized by two main seasons:

<ul>
    <li>The warm, wet season (Late December to June)</li>
    <li>The cool, dry season (Late June to December)</li>
</ul>

March and April usually being the hottest and wettest months. August is the coolest month.</p>
<h4>Landscape</h4>
<p>Situated in the Pacific Ocean some 1,000 km from the South American continent, these 19 
islands and the surrounding marine reserve have been called a unique living museum and showcase 
of evolution. Located at the confluence of three ocean currents, the Galapagos are a 
"melting pot" of marine species. Ongoing seismic and volcanic activity reflects the processes 
that formed the islands. These processes, together with the extreme isolation of the islands, 
led to the development of unusual animal life such as the land iguana, the giant tortoise and 
the many types of finch that inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection 
following his visit in 1835.Since the Galapagos Islands are from a volcanic origin you will see 
many craters. Some of these craters have salt water and some others have sweet water. Some Islands have 
black sand beaches and others have red sand beaches, which are a wonderful view.</p>

      <h3>Diet</h3>
      <p>The Galapagos penguin is a carnivore, that survives on a diet that is only comprised of marine animals. </p>

<h4>Prey and predator</h4>
<p>Prey species include krill, small anchovies, sardines, mullets and other various species of fish.There favourite food is krill.
These birds use their flippers to swim through the water and use their small, stout beaks to capture their prey.
They are dependent on the ocean currents to bring fish to their feeding grounds. They usually hunt in small, to occasionally large, groups. 
Since Galapagos penguins are smaller in size, it has many predators. When foraging for food in the water, Galapagos penguins are preyed 
upon by sharks and other large, marine animals.</p>

      <h3>Breeding</h3>
      <p>Galapagos Penguins can live for approxmietly for 15 to 20 years. Although, high mortality rates due to predation, starvation, disease and climatic events mean that wild Galapagos 
penguins usually do not live to such ages. With less and less galapagos penguins every year, people are trying to come up with ways to repopulate them.</p>
      <p>One way to repopulate galapagos penguins is to pair them up with each other. In the wild, Galapagos Penguins often pair up on their own, and they will breed 2 to 3 times per year 
if food is plentiful. They lay 1 to 2 eggs in a cave or rock crevice to protect them from the sunlight. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 38 to 40 days but if both eggs hatch, only 
one chick is ever raised. One parent always remains with the eggs or chick while the other one leaves to feed. For 30 days after hatching both parents tend to the chick and by the end of 
the 30 days the chick is able to be left while both adults go to sea. When the chick is 60 to 65 days old they have moulted and are ready to fledge. Females reach sexual maturity at 3 to 4 
years of age and males at 4 to 6 years of age. </p>

<h4>Did you know?</h4>
<ul>
    <li>There are no more than 1,000 breeding pairs all around the world</li>
    <li>The females lay eggs after every 4 days of interval</li>
    <li>The nesting period lasts from May to January</li>
    <li>The nests are built near water shore i.e. 50 m (160 feet)</li>
    <li>The period of incubation lasts for 38 to 40 days</li>
    <li>The chicks come out after 30 days of their birth</li>     
    <li>After 60 to 65 days chicks can take care of themselves</li>
</ul>
<h4>Breeding Season</h4>
<p>Galapagos penguins generally breed two to three times a year, breeding when food supplies are plentiful in the surrounding coastal waters.
The breeding season of Galapagos penguins lasts throughout the year; however, most breeding takes place between May and July.</p>

      <h3>Endangered Life</h3>
      <p> With less than 2000 Galapagos penguins left here on Earth...</p>
<h4>Reasons for being Endangered(Threats)</h4>
Penguins are threatened by pollution, bycatch and climate change. Introduced species, such as dogs, carry diseases that can spread to penguins as well, and cats pose a threat as predators. Past strong El Ni√±o events have caused mortalities of up to 77 percent, with dramatic declines of prey species and reduced breeding success.

The main threat facing this unique penguin is the increasing frequency of ENSO events, which reduce the strength of the cool currents this species needs to survive and causes fluctuations in its prey (6). The 1982-1983 ENSO resulted in the catastrophic loss of 77 percent of the Galapagos penguin population through starvation. A slow period of recovery followed, but the 1997-1998 ENSO resulted in another precipitous population crash of 66 percent. Such events may have a disproportionate affect on females, which can skew the sex ratio and make recovery from population crashes even slower (2). Furthermore, during periods of food shortages, the Galapagos penguin forages individually and makes no attempt to breed until sea temperatures decrease once again (4). 
Other threats facing this beleaguered penguin include global climate change, which may increase the frequency of ENSO events, accidental drowning in fisheries, oil spills, predation by introduced feral cats, and avian malaria, which is carried by mosquitoes brought to the Galapagos islands by humans in the 1980s (2).

The main threat facing this penguin is the fluctuation in food supply, compounded by El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a events. The 1982-1983 'El Ni√±o' Southern Oscillation (ENSO) resulted in the catastrophic loss of 77% of the population through starvation. A slow period of recovery followed, but the 1997-1998 ENSO resulted in another precipitous population crash of 66%. It is now thought that the species is experiencing another recovery phase. Other threats facing this beleaguered penguin include predation by introduced feral animals such as dogs and cats, increased disturbance by tourists, pollution (including oil spills), and fishing.

<h4>Conservation Status</h4>
<p>The Galapagos penguin is classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List.</p>
<br><img scr="http://www.arkive.org/rimg/species-detail/iucn/threat-categories-EN.gif"><br>

<h4>Protection Plan</h4>
All populations of the Galapagos penguin occur within the Galapagos National Park and Marine Reserve. At present, all populations are closely monitored and feral animals are controlled (2). 
Proposed measures to help this highly endangered species include discouraging the use of fishing nets in foraging areas, preventing coastal developments in breeding areas, and providing nest-boxes in predator free areas to allow research into the reproductive success of this species (2). 
As the population of the diminutive and uniquely adapted Galapagos penguin is so small and precarious, and restricted to just one breeding location, unfortunately this species is extremely vulnerable to extinction (2).
